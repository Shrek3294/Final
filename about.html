        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Barrio Tacos &amp; Cantina started as a small neighborhood taco stand with a simple goal:
          share the flavors we grew up with and create a place where everyone feels at home. Over the years,
          we have grown into a full cantina, but our heart has always stayed in the community that supported us
          from day one.
        </p>
        <p>
          For years we have been serving late-night tacos after local games, hosting family celebrations,
          and welcoming friends from just down the block and across town. Many of our recipes come from
          family kitchens, passed down, tweaked, and perfected on our grills.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe a good taqueria is more than a place to eat &mdash; it is a gathering spot.
          That is why we support neighborhood schools, local artists, and community events whenever we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          From sponsoring youth teams to donating meals for community fundraisers, we are proud to give back
          to the people who make this barrio feel like home. When you dine with us, you are supporting a local
          business that invests right back into the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being part of our story. We cannot wait to share our kitchen, our flavors,
          and our table with you for many more years to come.
